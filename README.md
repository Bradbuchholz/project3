# _Mr.Roboger's Neighborhood_

#### By _**Brad Buchholz**_

#### _A demonstration of array(s) and loop(s) with numbers and words!_
## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _JavaScript_

## Description

_This is a JavaScript program that will return an array from index 0 to the users inputted number. Once it returns the array, it will loop through the array and replace every number containing '3' with "Won't you be my neighbor?", every number that contains a 2 (but not a 3) with "Boop!", and every number that contains a 1 (but not a 3 or 2) with "Beep!"_

## Tests

_Test 1_
_Describe: beebBoop()_
_Test: "It should return an array of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number"_
_Code: beepBoop(5)_
_Expected Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]_

_Test 2_
_Describe: Beep()_
_Test: "It should replace all digits in a number containing 1 with "Beep!""_
_Code: modifyArray(1)_
_Expected Output: 104 is replaced with "Beep!"_

_Test 3_
_Describe: Boop()_
_Test: "It should replace all digits in a number containing 2 with "Boop!""_
_Code: Boop(2)_
_Expected Output: 207 is replaced with "Boop!"_

_Test 4
_Describe: Won't you be my neighbor?()_
_Test: "It should replace all digits in a number containing 3 with "Won't you be my neighbor?""_
_Code: Neighbor()_
_Expected Output: 38 is replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"_

_after tests were perfomed code was rewritten and simplified. Still meets all requirements, but not all variables are present in final code._
